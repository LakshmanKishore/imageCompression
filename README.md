# Image Compression

An end to end ML project.
I have used PCA(an unsupervised algorithm) to compress the image.
It takes the image from user and gives 3 different compressed images.
**No big UI still under development**.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/LakshmanKishore/imageCompression.git
```

Go to the project directory

```

Install dependencies

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the server

```bash
  python app.py
